When initializing Project in intelliJ for the first time, JDK 8 must be used. Without it, compilation will not succeed.

Main class is TabbedNotepad.java which has GUI and its components
Test.java contains syntax highlighter
RunAction.java contains run method

Rest of the classes are for sub-components and FontAction and ForeBackColorAction files are for styling of the editor
as every editor allows user to customize their editor to some degree as well.

Requirements Check from Project Criteria
- line 35 of the class Highlighter in Test.java is **nested class**

- line 94 shows usage of **lambda** expression in TabbedNotepad.java

- line 23 shows usage of implementing interface, fulfilling **polymorphism** requirement.
- javax.swing, java.awt used for GUI, using libraries **not taught in class**.
